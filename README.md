# classification-of-grouper-species-by-their-sounds-using-deep-neural-networks
In this code , a deep learning approach  for automaticclassification of grouper species by their vocalizations has been investigated.  We used one dimensional CNN with Discrete wavelet Transform,2D CNN with Spectrogram images,LSTM+DWT, and Alexnet+Spectrogram images to classify Grouper sounds.

 This work classify five different sounds: Red hind Grouper,Nassau Grouper, Yellow fin Grouper, Black Grouper, and other sounds such as motor sounds.
 ##The spectrogram of Red hind grouper sounds are shown below:
