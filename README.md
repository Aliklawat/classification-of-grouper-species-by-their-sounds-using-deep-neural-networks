# classification-of-grouper-species-by-their-sounds-using-deep-neural-networks
In this code , a deep learning approach  for automaticclassification of grouper species by their vocalizations has been investigated.  We used one dimensional CNN with Discrete wavelet Transform,2D CNN with Spectrogram images,LSTM+DWT, and Alexnet+Spectrogram images to classify Grouper sounds.
